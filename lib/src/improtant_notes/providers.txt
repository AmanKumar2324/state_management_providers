Provider Package in Flutter
Provider Package: Provider is a popular state management solution for Flutter applications. It simplifies the process of managing and sharing application state.

Create a Provider:

Define a class that extends ChangeNotifier to create a provider. In your example, ListProvider is a custom provider class.
State Management:

Store the application state within the provider class. In your ListProvider, you store a list of numbers.
Notify Listeners:

Use notifyListeners() method within the provider class to notify listeners (typically widgets) when the state changes. This triggers widget updates.
Wrap Widgets with Consumer:

Use the Consumer widget to listen to changes in the provider's state and automatically rebuild widgets when changes occur.
Access Provider Data:

To access data or methods from the provider, use the Consumer widget's builder function. This provides access to the provider instance.
Update Provider State:

To update the state within the provider, call methods provided by the provider class. In your example, you call ListProviderModel.add().
Navigating Between Screens:

You can pass the same provider instance between different screens/widgets to share the same state.
Providers in Widgets:

You often define providers in a widget's ancestor and access them in child widgets using Consumer or Provider.of.
Remember, the provider package is a flexible and efficient way to manage state in your Flutter applications, allowing you to separate state management from the UI and easily update widgets when the state changes.
